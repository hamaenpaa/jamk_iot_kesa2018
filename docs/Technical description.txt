This room log application contains following physical components:
- Raspberry Pi + NFC Reader

Operating system for Raspberry Pi is probably from
https://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads/

That is debian based Linux operating system.
PHP, MySQL, Apache, Python and PHP -> MySQL &
Python -> MySQL libraries at least needed to be 
installed.

Probably the disk image of the installations
from the memory card is now easiest way to continue
with installation part but if really needed 
it needs to be seached from Linux command history
what has been run to get parts working together.

The image of the raspberry PI & NFC Reader physical
installation ( wires etc. ) are as images in this
directory at files: connecting_wires.jpg and NFC reader.jpg

Technical features of the source code:

docs/data_structure.sql   contains the database structure
that needs to be run to MySQL database like

mysql -u[username] -p[password] ca <data_structure.sql

or copypasting to phpmyadmin sql query tab and running,
if phpmyadmin is installed.

Web source code general description
------------------------------------
html directory contains all the web code that needs to
be running under apache (php must be installed to be used
with apache).

css directory contains css styling. img directory contains
images.

Most php source code is under inc -directory where source
is organized according to sub modules. Each submodule
contains at inc root directory files like 
list_[module based_name].php  which works like including
all the needed sub files when first loading stuff under
sub directory for example module like Course (Kurssit)
except for settings this file is formed settings.php and 
contains more logic.

db_connect.php and db_disconnect_inc.php are files resposible
for creating and destroying database connection to MySQL
database. Database connection parameters for Web connection
needs to be set to db_connect_inc.php (username, password,
host).

Login and logout files and navigation are handled with 
index.php, login.php, login_confirm.php, logout.php and
navigation.php.

For layout there is also footer.php and header.php
For datepicker there exists datepicker.php and for some
directory configuration config.php

There is jQuery plugin for datetime picker used
for date, time and datetime selection.

There is utils -directory that contains common routines
used in many modules and especially routines for topic
searching under different modules.

AJAX is largely used in application through jQuery get 
calls. Only the first seeking and table data is build
directly when opening the module page. Then clicking
of buttons etc. executes Javascript functions under
html/js folder. There exists js file for each module.
AJAX calls use JSON as response. 
Parameters are URI encoded.

PHP database operations use PHP prepared statements
for security reasons. Using prepared statements prevents
SQL injection attacks as far as google searching results
regarding that showed correct information. However they 
may echo error messages. It is unimplemented still how 
to hide/mask those error messages from getting to 
Web browser console, etc. if there response is console
logged. However those error messages should occur only
if something really goes wrong and perhaps if losing
database connection which is fatal situation anyway.
There might be things still to do. Typically ajax routines also
check http session existence before doing any database 
operations if the routine is such that is only to 
be used for logged in user. By module following files 
are database related:

course:
-------
add_lesson_to_course.php
course_fetch_from_db.php
fetch_course_with_id.php
get_course_lessons_ajax.php
get_course_page_ajax.php
get_new_avail_lessons_ajax.php
save_course.php
remove_course.php
remove_lesson_from_course.php

Typically ..._from_db.php is container for functions
returning result set etc. from database and others
and AJAX routines performing database routines
and returning responses from them.

lesson
------
add_topic_to_lesson.php
fetch_lesson_with_id.php
fetch_avail_lesson_topics.php
get_lesson_page_ajax.php
lessons_fetch_from_db.php
remove_lesson.php
remove_lesson_topic.php
save_lesson.php

room_log
--------
download_as_csv.php  
- this routine is used to build csv file from room log data
fetch_room_log_data_from_db.php
get_new_room_log.php
get_room_log_page_ajax.php

settings
--------
fetch_settings_from_db.php
save_settings.php

topic
-----
fetch_topic_with_id.php
get_topic_page_ajax.php
remove_topic.php
save_topic.php
topics_fetch_from_db.php

user
----
get_user_page_ajax.php
get_user_with_id.php
remove_user.php
save_user.php
user_fetch_from_db.php

utils
-----
sql_utils.php
get_page_and_page_page_sizes.php
list_topics_ajax.php
topic_selections.php

User interface oriented files under modules are
------------------------------------------------

course
------
course_and_or_modify_form.php
course_listing_table.php
course_seek_form.php
list_course_lessons.php  <--- This may be not needed anymore

lesson
------
lesson_add_or_modify_form.php
lesson_seek_form.php
lesson_listing_table.php

room_log
--------
room_log_listing_table.php
room_log_seek_form.php


For settings all ui code is at settings.php under main level
( not at sub level ).

topic
-----
seek_topic_form.php
topic_add_or_modify_form.php
topic_listing_table.php

user
----
user_add_or_modify_form.php
user_listing_table.php
user_seek_form.php

utils
-----
html_utils.php


There are html generating functions for especially 
simplifying/shortening code for bootstrap oriented
responsive grid generation for representing and
manipulating tabular kind of application data.

utils.js contains similar kind of routines to 
be used after JSON responses are returned.

Lists of data are typically paged and there exists
routines for creating those page lists and their
links. Page, page count, page page and page page count
kind of informations belong to those generations.

Typically also queries preserve the last query parameters
used so that new changes at input fields won't effect
them before Seek kind of button is pushed by user.
Some informations like that are at nonvisible div tags
at HTML page when pages are run and javascript routines
get those values there before using AJAX to fetch
different page in page list for example. Fetching page
also always returns whole page because another user
may have changed the situation.

There exists also Javascript -validations. Texts of 
the user interface are all at finnish language.

Now there also exists problems with long texts
at tables: they just run over the borders of table
cell. Database routines replace spaces often with nbsp;
to keep texts at same line. If those are left to spaces
then there occurs funny kind of coloring at cells etc.
There needs to be something for this...

If roomlog table contains now rows, the headers of 
columns are shown and that seems a bit funny.


NFC Reader Python routines
--------------------------
Source code that uses NFC Reader to read NFC tag
is under python directory.

That uses probably source code found from

https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_Python_PN532

for communication with NFC Reader.


test directory
--------------
passwordgenerator.php  creates hashed value for
inserting to database for passwords are hashed there.

test_room_log_generator.php  is used to simulate
new student etc. getting into room.
